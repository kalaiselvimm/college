Pondicherry Engineering College,"Awesome college, great job opportunities if you are in CS",5,1
Pondicherry Engineering College,"    It is a government college that will allow to get placed at better companies . But if you are an average student or below you will surely suffer alot. Although some professors are exceptional, professors here wont teach you the ABC....you need to know the ABC from schools onwards. In terms of infrastructure only the Administration block and the theatres are the only buildings that can be taken into consideration. Hostels are horrible (No need to explain here). The campus is a jungle full of wild animals. There is no ambulance provided in case of emergency (like snake bite or scorpion bite). 
 Actually it is a college for the localite only and not for other states students. Other states students need to pay extra money for the college tuition fee. The hostel fee has reached similar to that of private colleges. 
 It is under pondicherry university, from my experience it is the worst university I have ever seen. Full of corruption. By chance if you have arrear and you want to apply for revaluation. Then my request is don't waste your money for revaluation. There is no transparency on how they re-evaluate your paper. And it will reflect on your mark sheet that when others got the mark sheet and you will not get it. 
 So choose your college wisely before you regret it. :)    ",1,3

Rajiv Gandhi College of Engineering and Technology,Good college.. im a kabadi player..great encouragement from management..I won many nationals..thank you,5,8
Rajiv Gandhi College of Engineering and Technology,Rightfully the best one in pondicherry. I started my first year as a stranger and I was never spared to be an aghorophobian thereafter. The culture right from non-teaching staffs to head of the institution is fanta-fabulous. Best infrastructure and students have their own legacy to think free and improvise themselves. The management has now started to focus on student's ability in other domains rather than academics during weekends. The fees structure is so cool comparatively and the method of implementing syllabus into students is a perfect fit. Together we live as a family and we welcome every permanent guest to this beautiful ambience. PROUD TO BE RGCETIAN,5,18

The placement trainings that are provided by the institution is also helped me for this. I cannot say anything favourable to the management and also not against it. My small advice would be nothing new but assistive that wherever we are, we should have the insight to shape our future.""No one will tell you what to do next in your life as you are already 18"". Now you are on your own. So be an extraordinary personage. And inevitably, we can never blame others for our life. Happy engineering : )",1,25

Rajiv Gandhi College of Engineering and Technology,"Worst college to Study. No proper teaching by the faculty. Salary is not given to the staffs properly so they are not working properly in the college.

Rajiv Gandhi College of Engineering and Technology,"This is the honest review. People might have a different perspective before joining this college. For the past 2 years, the college degraded itself. Believe even the staffs but not the principal. In order to attract the people, administration started various clubs ( sports, dance, tech, etc.,) right before joining time and after that, that's it. Students wrote retests and assignments but still administration didn't put internal marks for them. This resulted in the great steep in the result....Don't ever ever ever ever ever ever fall for the fantasy you see. Better ask for some other people's advice and join.

Sri Manakula Vinayagar Engineering College,"Probably one of the strictest colleges in the world. A typical day at SMVEC goes like this-Memorise.Vomit.Repeat. Don't join this college because it's building looks good or because the website looks catchy. 
What matters is the quality of the teachers and a positive environment. This central jail lacks any of these aspects. There is nothing called as college life in here. If you find this review biased and misleading, you can enquire the alumnus of this college yourself. [Kandal ariyathavan kondal ariyum :)]

Manakula Vinayagar Institute of Technology,"The college is very okayish infrastructure wise , and you will be shot at tremendously with some Hectic work everyday, you will not feel like doing your homework/assigned everyday work when you see the amount of work given.the staffs show partiality towards certain students.The staffs also ask the students to do some work that is personal to them i.e something unofficial towards the college.but one good habit here is that they don't like to fail their students in the semester exams .the internal's are conducted normally,but then if you fail the internal you have to stay back up to 6 pm . MY conclusion is that the student will go through extremely high mental pressure and won't have rest ,not even second saturday's are holidays.no rest ,no peace,no life(you wouldn't even get the slightest of a college environment rather a school like experience).",1,1

Manakula Vinayagar Institute of Technology,"The college is excellent for its infrastructure and the skills can be developed only by the students. Don't expect any other from the institution. EXPECTATION HURTS. NO HOLIDAYS ON SATURDAYS. In a specific department, there is always an issue of low placement count. The main reason for this is the low Lab Grades which is put up by the academic staffs and blamming students for not getting placed in a higher rate than other departments. Many good studying peoples miss their opportunities by having good grades in theory papers and low grades in practical papers, the CGPA goes down and they miss the elligibility opportunites for some MNC's. The training given to SMVEC is more aggressive considering to MVIT students regarding the placement and blamming us students not giving good placement counts.",2,2
